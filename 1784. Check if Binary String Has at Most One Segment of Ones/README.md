## Problem


Given a binary string  `s`  **â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹without leading zeros**, return  `true`â€‹â€‹â€‹  _if_ `s` _contains  **at most one contiguous segment of ones**_. Otherwise, return  `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1001"
Output: false
Explanation: The ones do not form a contiguous segment.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "110"
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
-   `s[i]`â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ is either  `'0'`  or  `'1'`.
-   `s[0]`  is `'1'`.

## Approach Explanation

Checking whether the binary string contains the substring "01". If this substring is present, it indicates the existence of at least two contiguous segments of ones, and the function returns `false`. Conversely, if the substring is not found, it implies that the ones in the string form a single, unbroken sequence, and the function returns `true`. My approach prioritizes simplicity and readability by utilizing the `contains` method to directly assess the presence of the specified substring, offering a concise solution to the problem.
