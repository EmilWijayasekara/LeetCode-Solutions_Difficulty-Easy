## Problem

You are given a  **0-indexed**  array  `words`  consisting of  **distinct**  strings.

The string  `words[i]`  can be paired with the string  `words[j]`  if:

-   The string  `words[i]`  is equal to the reversed string of  `words[j]`.
-   `0 <= i < j < words.length`.

Return  _the  **maximum**  number of pairs that can be formed from the array_ `words`_._

Note that each string can belong in **at most one**  pair.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["cd","ac","dc","ca","zz"]
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, we can form 2 pair of strings in the following way:
- We pair the 0th string with the 2nd string, as the reversed string of word[0] is "dc" and is equal to words[2].
- We pair the 1st string with the 3rd string, as the reversed string of word[1] is "ca" and is equal to words[3].
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["ab","ba","cc"]
Output: 1
Explanation: In this example, we can form 1 pair of strings in the following way:
- We pair the 0th string with the 1st string, as the reversed string of words[1] is "ab" and is equal to words[0].
It can be proven that 1 is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["aa","ab"]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this example, we are unable to form any pair of strings.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= words.length <= 50`
-   `words[i].length == 2`
-   `words` consists of distinct strings.
-   `words[i]` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Approach Explanation
I examined all possible pairs, checking if each pair met the specified conditions of reversibility. Specifically, I compared the first character of one string with the second character of another and vice versa. The resulting count represents the maximum number of valid pairs that can be formed from the array. While this approach provides a correct solution, it relies on a brute-force method, potentially leading to inefficiencies for larger input sizes.
