## Problem


A  **sentence**  is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of  **only**  uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).

-   For example,  `"Hello World"`,  `"HELLO"`, and  `"hello world hello world"`  are all sentences.

You are given a sentence  `s`​​​​​​ and an integer  `k`​​​​​​. You want to  **truncate**  `s`​​​​​​ such that it contains only the  **first**  `k`​​​​​​ words. Return  `s`​​​​_​​ after  **truncating**  it._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "Hello how are you Contestant", k = 4
Output: "Hello how are you"
Explanation:
The words in s are ["Hello", "how" "are", "you", "Contestant"].
The first 4 words are ["Hello", "how", "are", "you"].
Hence, you should return "Hello how are you".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "What is the solution to this problem", k = 4
Output: "What is the solution"
Explanation:
The words in s are ["What", "is" "the", "solution", "to", "this", "problem"].
The first 4 words are ["What", "is", "the", "solution"].
Hence, you should return "What is the solution".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "chopper is not a tanuki", k = 5
Output: "chopper is not a tanuki"
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 500`
-   `k`  is in the range  `[1, the number of words in s]`.
-   `s`  consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
-   The words in  `s`  are separated by a single space.
-   There are no leading or trailing spaces.

## Approach Explanation
I took the string split it word by word and put it into another string. And return till `k`th word.
